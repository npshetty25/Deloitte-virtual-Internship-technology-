# Deloitte virtual Internship technology
This repository contains my submission for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. In this program, participants assist Daikibo Industrials—a global leader in heavy machinery manufacturing—in tackling a range of technical challenges.

## 🧑‍💻 Task 01 – Coding
Daikibo is implementing IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to track and improve their manufacturing processes. However, their systems output telemetry data in two different formats. Our job was to merge these files into one.

Through this task, I learned how to work with JSON data in Python and use the unittest framework to write and run automated tests.

## 📝 Task 02 – Development
While offline data analysis is helpful, having live insights and smart alerts is even more valuable. Daikibo’s tech team requested a proposal for a real-time manufacturing dashboard.

This task taught me how to create a clear and compelling software development proposal.

## 🔒 Task 03 – Cyber Security
A data leak raised concerns about a possible breach of Daikibo’s internal status board. I analyzed web logs and identified suspicious access patterns that suggested unauthorized activity.

From this task, I learned how to read web logs and detect unusual behavior that may indicate a security threat.
